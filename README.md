# Reinforcement Learning Basics 
### (This is a "beginners only" repo)

- For people new to RL. This is based on Phil Tabor's lectures
- Have simplified some steps - them seemed too "compact" - so expanded them in order to help beginners understand them better 
- Have added some explanatory code comments too
