# Reinforcement Learning Algorithms
### This is where I am learning the core RL algorithms from "scratch"

- Basic algorithms - from scratch
- Have simplified some steps - them seemed too "compact" - so expanded them in order to help beginners understand them better 
- Have added some explanatory code comments too

**To-do**
1. Adapt the naive DQN to a predictive maintenance problem
2. Upload data from file
3. Prepare/pre-process data
4. Build and train Agent
